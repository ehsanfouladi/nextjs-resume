I serve as CTO at LenoSell (formerly iSips), steering the technical vision and execution of an e-commerce ecosystem that spans shop, order, and product microservices. My focus is scaling Django/DRF platforms, evolving REST and gRPC integrations, and keeping infrastructure observable, secure, and production-ready.

Alongside that role I continue to take on select freelance engagements, leveraging 6+ years of full-stack experience with Django, React, PostgreSQL, and modern DevOps practices to deliver high-quality products on time and within budget. I thrive in collaborative environments that value ownership, rapid iteration, and measurable impact.
