A web application that allows managers of the Metil Hamyar Company (the biggest company in Iran that transport iron ore from different parts of country to iron foundries) to store all transportation data including rail and road transportation and their laboratory results for each cargo. I was responsible to design and develop both back-end and front-end using Django REST Framework and React.js
